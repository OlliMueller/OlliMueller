### Hi there 👋

**OlliMueller/OlliMueller** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## About Me
I'm Oliver from Munich, 34 years old, married and father of two sons. After six fulfilling years as a Community Pastor at ICF Munich, I'm currently taking my next step in my **training as a Web Developer at Coding Bootcamp Europe**. I'm looking forward to this new challenge / Challenge accepted 🙌

## Goal
I am passionate about **empowering people to reach their full potential** so they can have a positive impact on those around them. 

This goal drives me to give my best every day. From now on I want to contribute as a web developer to create new things, solve problems and give people a platform and visibility through websites. 

## Vision
It is the vision of me and my family to **move to Japan** in the future to make a difference in our environment through our work and also through our being. 

## Fun Fact
I am a passionate **improv theater** player and teacher.

## Contributions
_coming soon :)_
