### Hi there 👋


## About Me 🙋‍♂️
I'm Oliver from Munich, 34 years old, married and father of two sons. After six fulfilling years as a Community Pastor at ICF Munich, I'm currently taking my next step in my **training as a Web Developer at Coding Bootcamp Europe**. I'm looking forward to this new challenge: Challenge accepted!

## Goal 🥅
I am passionate about **empowering people to reach their full potential** so they can have a positive impact on those around them. 
This goal drives me to give my best every day. From now on I want to contribute as a web developer to create new things, solve problems and give people a platform and visibility through websites. 

## Vision 🇯🇵
It is the vision of me and my family to **move to Japan** in the future to make a difference in our environment through our work and also through our being. 

## Fun Fact 🎭
I am a passionate **improv theater** player and teacher.

## Contributions 👨‍💻
_coming soon :)_
